        1. Link to Python & Flask Back-End repository: [https://github.com/BryantCabrera/letsplay-flask](https://github.com/BryantCabrera/letsplay-flask). 
2.	On your personal repo (NOT the General Assembly) enterprise, log in.  then click link above and fork the repo.  Make sure the repo is in your personal GitHub (go to your personal GitHub account and the project repo “relocater” should be there).  Then, from YOUR PERSONAL FORK, clone it to your local repo.
    1.	$git clone {without curly braces, put the clone link here}
    2.  $git remote add upstream https://github.com/BryantCabrera/letsplay-react
3.	In terminal, cd to the project repo, open it, and $git checkout -b {without these curly braces, put your first name here in all lower case letters}
    1.	EXAMPLE:  $git checkout -b bryant
    2.	**any other time you are changing back to your branch, you don’t need to type the “-b” part anymore
4.	$npm install

    3.	Models
    4.	Public
    5.	Routers

    1.	src (where you will be making ALL components)
    2.	public
7.	When you are 100% sure your data is ready to be merged into the master copy, make sure you are on YOUR OWN BRANCH (lower left of VScode), call Bryant to let him know you're merging, then:
    1.	$git add -A
    2.	$git commit -m “Adds {put your name here}’s {2-3 word description of the feature/code you made}”
    3.	$git push origin {without the curly braces, branchname}

    4.  go to your PERSONAL GitHub repo
        1.  OPTION 1: on your PERSONAL GitHub repo, accept and merge the pull requests
        2.  OPTION 2 (if you don't see the green button ABOVE the clone/download button on the right): 
            1. in your PERSONAL remote repo, use the dorpdown on the left to switch to the branch that you made updates to
            2.  click the "New Pull Request" button directly to the right of that dropdown menu
            3.  on the new screen, make sure the left side points to the origin master, and the right side points to your personal branch that has your edits
8.  Make sure your local repo is always in sync.
    1.  make sure you don't have any pending commits, then
    2.  $git checkout master
    3.  Bryant will let you know when to $git pull upstream master
    4.  $git branch -D {without the curly braces, your name all in lowercase}
        1. this deletes your old branch

            (b)	Description: {line numbers} : Describe in detail what change you made and what it does.
